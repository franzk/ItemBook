# ItemBook

ItemBook is a project that I use to practice Kotlin.
The project is in progress. I will make regular pushes to improve it or add new features.

The goal of ths Android App is to propose to the user to manage the inventory of his house.

The project implements:
- Kolin
- MVVM
- Room database
- Coroutines
- LiveData
- Two-way binding
- Camera
- Gallery

# How to use it

In Android Studio : VCS -> Get from version control

# Personal Note
This is my first Android project and I am very enthusiastic about Android programming.

Feel free to interact with me about it, I will gratefully accept your ideas and advice.
